# inference-service-examples

This project is about how to deal with the basic functionality of KServe

## Preliminary note

It is assumed that a Minikube cluster is used and that KServe has been installed. Instructions for setting up the setup used here will be provided soon.

## Directories

* ``/deploy``: contains Kubernetes manifests managed by kustomize
* ``/model``: contains models to serve 
* ``/presentation``: contains presentations in different formats
* ``/scripts``: contains scripts for demonstrating the functionality
